# FHIR Constants Mapping

## Introduction
To enable a compact encoding of FHIR data structures in CBOR, we introduce a bijective mapping between selected constants and short identifiers. An identifier is an unsigned integer that is assigned according to the table below. In CBOR, this identifier must be tagged. 

## Tag registration template

```
Data item: unsigned integer
Semantics: Identifier for a FHIR constant
Point of Contact: stefan.genchev@tum.de
Description of semantics: TBA
```

## Mapping

> The mapping will be published when version 1 of the bar code specification is finalized.
